# About this repository

This repository contains following Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).
Most of directory does not have .py, but has .ipynb .

# List of GANs

Currently, the following kind of GANs are implemented.

## GANs for generating images

* vanilla GAN(implemented by keras)
* DCGAN
* unrolled GAN
* BEGAN
* WGAN
* WGAN-gp
* Cramer-GAN

## GANs for Image-to-Image transfer

* cycleGAN

## Not GAN

* VAE
